# Smart-Agriculture-using-IoT-and-Machine-Learning
The project uses Arduino UNO with multiple sensors attached to it like  Soil Moisture sensor, Photoelectric Diode Sensor,Humidity sensor etc that takes reading on a periodic basis.The mission of the project is to intimate the farmers or other stakeholders in predicting when the crop is about to deteriorate. This is accomplished by a Machine Learning Layer that has been modeled to identify the degradation of a crop's health before its degradation starts. It uses KNN-algorithm to cluster the crops according to the impeding eventuality.The next iteration identifies the most probable cause and thorugha UI intimates the stakeholder whta steps needs to be taken to prevent crop-failure
